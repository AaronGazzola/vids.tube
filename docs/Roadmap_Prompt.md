# Project Roadmap Template & Instructions

The roadmap is an ordered sequence of detailed, specific, technical instructions to implement ALL of the requested functionality. Do not skip any functionality, the roadmap needs to be exhaustive. Don't include any testing in the roadmap.
Only mark a task as complete when the feature that the task describes is fully implemented.

## Purpose & Intended Use

A project roadmap serves as:

- **Implementation Guide**: Step-by-step instructions for building complete features
- **Progress Tracker**: Live document showing current status and remaining work
- **Reference Document**: Historical record of development decisions and implementations
- **Scope Manager**: Clear boundaries for what gets built in each phase

## Roadmap Structure & Format

### 1. Document Header

# [Project Name] Complete Implementation Roadmap

Brief description of what the roadmap accomplishes and its scope.

## üéØ Current Status (Updated: [Date])

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED PHASES

- **Phase 1: [Name]** - Brief description of completed work
- **Phase 2: [Name]** - Brief description of completed work

### üîÑ IN PROGRESS

- **[Current Phase]**: Brief description of current work

### ‚è≥ REMAINING WORK

- **[Next Phase]**: Brief description of upcoming work
- **[Future Phase]**: Brief description of future work

### üöÄ READY TO USE

Detailed list of what users can currently do with the application:

- Feature 1 with specific capabilities
- Feature 2 with specific capabilities
- **NEW**: Recently added features highlighted

### üìç NEXT STEPS

1. Immediate next action items
2. Priority tasks for current phase
3. Preparation work for upcoming phases

### 2. Prerequisites Section

## Prerequisites

- ‚úÖ Environment setup requirements
- ‚úÖ Dependencies and integrations
- ‚úÖ Database schema and configurations
- ‚úÖ API keys and external services

### 3. Phase Structure

Each phase should follow this pattern:

## ‚úÖ Phase X: [Phase Name] (STATUS)

Brief description of phase goals and deliverables.

### ‚úÖ X.1 [Component Name] (`file/path.ts`) - STATUS

Description of what needs to be implemented:

- Specific requirement 1 with technical details
- Specific requirement 2 with technical details
- Error handling and edge cases
- Integration points with other components

**Key Methods/Features Required:**

- `methodName(params)` - Description of functionality
- `anotherMethod(params)` - Description of functionality

### ‚úÖ X.2 [Another Component] - STATUS

[Follow same pattern as above]

## Content Organization Guidelines

### Task Breakdown

1. **Component Level**: Break down by files or logical components
2. **Method Level**: Specify exact functions and APIs needed
3. **Integration Level**: Define how components interact

### Technical Details

Include in each task:

- File paths where code will be implemented
- Key methods and their signatures
- Integration points with existing code

## Status Management System

### Status Indicators

- **‚úÖ COMPLETED**: Feature is fully implemented
- **üîÑ IN PROGRESS**: Currently being worked on
- **‚è≥ REMAINING**: Planned for future implementation
- **üöÄ READY TO USE**: Available for users in current state

### Progress Tracking

- Update status section with each major milestone
- Move completed items from "IN PROGRESS" to "COMPLETED"
- Add new features discovered during implementation
- Maintain "READY TO USE" section showing current capabilities

### Git Integration

- Commit messages should reference phase completion: `feat(phaseX): complete [Phase Name] implementation`
- Tag major milestones for easy reference
- Include roadmap updates in feature commits

## Pre-Final Step: App-Wide Styling Polish & Refactor

Before production build validation, perform a comprehensive styling assessment and refactor:

1. Assess entire application styling for consistency and modern aesthetics
2. Implement dark and light mode using latest Tailwind CSS v4 approach
3. Ensure modern, elegant, and consistent styling across all components
4. Verify sufficient spacing and padding throughout the application
5. Validate adequate contrast between all text and background colors in both modes
6. Check for and fix any styling inconsistencies or accessibility issues
7. Ensure responsive design works correctly across all breakpoints

## Final Step: Production Build Validation

The final step of every roadmap implementation is to validate the production build:

1. Run `npm run build`
2. Fix any errors that occur during the build process
3. Address all warnings until none remain
4. Repeat until the build completes successfully with zero errors and zero warnings

This ensures all code is production-ready and free of type errors, import issues, or configuration problems.
